# PNPM TOOLS

## Purpose Of The Tools

Using a combination of pnpm audit and querying npm for recent package updates, this tool replaces pnpm install command with a script that prevents installation of packages flagged with advisories and recently updated. The second condition has been applied due to recent supply chain attacks on the NPM registry.
